# Ruins
## About
Ruins is a small Minecraft clone written fully in C/C++ aswell as GLSL for shaders.
## Getting the source code
Make sure that when you obtain the source code, you use `git`, with the `--recursive` parameter:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dashbloxx/ruins.git
```
## Requirements
You will need CMake & some sort of C compiler. Building with CMake will build the required libraries & ruins itself.
